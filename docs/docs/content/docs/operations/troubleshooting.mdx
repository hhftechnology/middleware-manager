## Plugins not taking effect

- Verify `TRAEFIK_STATIC_CONFIG_PATH` inside MM points to the mounted static file.
- Ensure Traefik was restarted after install/remove.
- Check Traefik logs for plugin load errors; confirm plugin key matches middleware config.

## Middlewares missing in Traefik

- Confirm the middleware is **assigned** to at least one resource.
- Check **Traefik Explorer → Middlewares** for provider `@file`.
- Ensure cache was refreshed (`/api/traefik-config/invalidate`) and wait for regenerate interval.

## Service override not used

- Router must point to the custom service name; reassign if necessary.
- For TCP/UDP, ensure servers use `address` (not `url`) and correct port/protocol.

## mTLS failures

- Confirm `mtlswhitelist` plugin exists in static config and Traefik was restarted.
- Check CA path and per-resource overrides (rules/headers) for JSON errors.
- Look at Traefik TLS handshake errors in logs.

## Data source errors

- Test connection in Settings; verify URLs and basic auth.
- If Traefik API is behind auth/proxy, ensure credentials are set in `config.json`.

## HTTP provider conflicts

- If Traefik `providers.http.endpoint` no longer points to Middleware Manager, overrides will not apply. Restore the endpoint and invalidate cache.
