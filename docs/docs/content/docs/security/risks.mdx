title: Security & Misconfiguration Risks
description: Critical cautions when modifying middlewares, services, and Traefik config.
---

<Callout type="warning" title="Live traffic impact">
Middleware, router, and service changes affect production paths immediately. Use staging hosts and change windows.
</Callout>

## Common risks

- **ForwardAuth / BasicAuth**: incorrect endpoints or secrets can lock out users.
- **Headers**: overwriting `Host` or removing security headers can break origin checks or weaken protections.
- **RateLimit**: too-low thresholds can DOS your own services; too-high can leave you unprotected.
- **Redirects/Rewrites**: regex errors can create open redirects or bypass auth chains.
- **Priority changes**: raising priority can route traffic to unintended routers.
- **Custom services**: mis-typed backends or protocol mismatch (HTTP vs TCP) lead to outages.

## Plugin-specific risks

- Installing untrusted plugins can execute arbitrary code in Traefik.
- Static config path mistakes mean plugins are “installed” in UI but not loaded, leading to false confidence.
- Always restart Traefik after plugin changes and monitor logs.

## mTLS risks

- Wrong CA path or missing `mtlswhitelist` plugin breaks TLS handshakes.
- Over-broad rules or disabled verification can expose internal services.

## Recommended controls

- Version-control Traefik static config and keep backups.
- Use staged entrypoints/hosts to validate middleware chains before production.
- Monitor Traefik access/error logs and health after each change.
- Limit dashboard/API exposure; prefer network-level ACLs.
