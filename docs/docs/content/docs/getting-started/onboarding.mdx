description: First-time setup, picking a data source, and key UI steps.

## Goal

Get Middleware Manager running with a chosen data source (Pangolin or Traefik), confirm connectivity, and complete first UI actions.

<Callout type="warning" title="Misconfiguration risk">
Routers and middlewares directly affect live traffic. Start in a staging environment, then promote tested changes.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- Traefik v2/v3 reachable from Middleware Manager
- Docker runtime for the provided containers
- Mount points for database and Traefik rules (see Deploy pages)

## First boot checklist

1) Start the stack (Pangolin or standalone) using the Deploy guides.  
2) Open the UI: `http://<host>:3456`.  
3) Run **Settings → Test Connection** for the active data source; switch to Traefik or Pangolin as needed.  
4) Verify **Dashboard** loads counts for Routers/Services/Middlewares.  
5) Visit **Resources** and open any resource to confirm router details.  
6) Enable **Dark mode** if preferred (persists in local storage).

## Initial data-source selection

- **Pangolin**: use when Pangolin already owns the authoritative Traefik config.
- **Traefik**: use when Traefik is the primary provider and you want direct control.

Switch via **Settings → Active Data Source**. Middleware Manager writes overrides to Traefik’s file provider directory (default `/conf`).

## Safe first changes

- Create a non-critical middleware (e.g., `headers` with `X-Debug: 1`) and assign it to a staging router.
- Create a small custom service (load balancer with one backend) and assign it to a staging host.
- Use **Traefik Explorer** to confirm the router/service/middleware exists and is healthy.

## What’s next

- Pick your deployment path:  
  - <Card title="With Pangolin" href="/docs/getting-started/deploy-pangolin" />  
  - <Card title="Standalone Traefik" href="/docs/getting-started/deploy-standalone" />  
- Then review configuration details: <Card title="Configuration" href="/docs/configuration/config-overview" />.
