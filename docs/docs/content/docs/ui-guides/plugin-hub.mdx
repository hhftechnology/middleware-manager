## How it works

- Reads/writes `experimental.plugins` in Traefik static config at `TRAEFIK_STATIC_CONFIG_PATH`.
- Requires Traefik restart to load/unload plugin code.

## Workflow

1) Ensure `TRAEFIK_STATIC_CONFIG_PATH` points to the mounted static config inside MM.  
2) Browse catalogue or list existing plugins.  
3) **Install**: writes the plugin entry; restart Traefik.  
4) Create a middleware of type `plugin` using the same key.  
5) Assign the middleware to resources.

Static config changes do not take effect until Traefik restarts.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

- Wrong static config path → install appears to “succeed” but Traefik won’t load the plugin.
- Plugin key mismatch → middleware fails to resolve.
- Check Traefik logs for plugin load errors.
