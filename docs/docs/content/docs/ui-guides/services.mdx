description: Define custom Traefik services and override resource backends.
---

## Service types

- **loadBalancer**: HTTP/TCP/UDP backends with optional health checks, sticky sessions, and passHostHeader.
- **weighted**: distribute across named services with weights.
- **mirroring**: mirror a percentage of traffic to secondary services.
- **failover**: primary/fallback pair with health checks.

## Create / edit

- Provide JSON config; templates appear if `templates_services.yaml` exists.
- For TCP/UDP, use `address` instead of `url`.

## Assign to a resource

- Open a resource → **Service override** → pick a custom service.
- Removes the default backend for that router; ensure the custom service references valid targets.

## Validation tips

- Use health checks where possible.
- For weighted/mirroring, ensure referenced services exist (names must include provider suffix when required, e.g., `service-id@file`).
- Confirm in **Traefik Explorer → Services** that the service appears under the file provider and is healthy.
