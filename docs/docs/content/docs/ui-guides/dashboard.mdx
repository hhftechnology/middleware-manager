The dashboard surfaces counts for routers, services, and middlewares from the active data source plus quick links to key areas.

Use the dashboard to:

- Confirm connectivity (non-zero counts and no API errors).
- Jump to Resources, Middlewares, Services, Plugin Hub, or Security.
- Spot anomalies after deploys (sudden drops in router/service counts).
