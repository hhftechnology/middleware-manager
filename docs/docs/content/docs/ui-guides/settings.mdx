## Data source

## Theme & UI

- Toggle **Dark mode**; persisted in local storage (`middleware-manager-app` store).
- Sidebar collapse state is also persisted.

## When to retest

- After Traefik endpoint changes
- After rotating Pangolin credentials
- After network topology changes (e.g., new VPN/bridge)
