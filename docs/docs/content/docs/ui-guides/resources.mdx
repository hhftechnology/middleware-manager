## List view

- Displays resources discovered from the active data source.
- Click a resource to open detail and router controls.

## Resource detail

Tabs and actions:

- **HTTP config**: entrypoints, TLS domains (SANs), custom headers, router priority.
- **TCP config**: entrypoints and SNI rules when TCP is enabled.
- **mTLS toggle**: enable/disable per resource; uses `mtlswhitelist` middleware with optional per-resource overrides.
- **Middlewares**: assign/remove; priority ordering is preserved (higher runs first).
- **Service override**: assign/remove a custom service to replace the default backend.

<Callout type="warning" title="Header changes affect backends">
Custom request headers (e.g., `Host`) change what your upstream sees. Test carefully before applying to production routers.
</Callout>

## Tips

- Use staging hosts to validate new middleware chains.
- Router priority defaults to `100`; raise/lower to control matching precedence.
- For TCP, ensure entrypoints and SNI rules align with your certificates.
