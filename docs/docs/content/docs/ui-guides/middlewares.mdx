description: Create, update, and assign Traefik middlewares with priorities.
---

## Create / edit

- Choose a **type** (e.g., `headers`, `forwardAuth`, `rateLimit`, `redirectRegex`, `plugin`).
- Provide JSON config; templates appear if `templates.yaml` is present.
- Saving stores the middleware in the database; it is emitted to Traefik only when assigned to a resource.

## Assign to resources

- From a resource detail page, add middlewares and set **priority** (higher number runs first).
- Bulk assignment is supported via the multi-add flow.

## Plugin middlewares

- Use type `plugin` and set the plugin key matching `experimental.plugins.<key>` in Traefik static config.
- Ensure the plugin is installed via **Plugin Hub** and Traefik restarted.

## Recommendations

- Keep middleware names descriptive (`auth-forward-prod`, `headers-hsts-strict`).
- Use priorities to ensure auth/logging runs before rewrites or header injection.
- Validate via **Traefik Explorer → Middlewares** to confirm they appear under the file provider.
