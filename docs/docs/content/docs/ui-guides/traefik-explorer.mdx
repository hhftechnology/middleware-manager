description: Inspect routers, services, middlewares directly from Traefik API.

Use this view to verify what Traefik currently serves, independent of Pangolin.

- **Routers**: filter by HTTP/TCP/UDP; check rules, middlewares, service targets.
- **Services**: view load balancers, weights, mirroring, failover.
- **Middlewares**: confirm middleware presence and provider (file/http/docker).
- **Overview/Version/Entrypoints** panels provide quick health signals.

<Callout type="info" title="Provider awareness">
Middleware Manager emits overrides via the **file** provider. Confirm your expected objects appear under `@file`.
</Callout>
