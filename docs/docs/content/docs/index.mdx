# Overview

Middleware Manager lets you attach Traefik middlewares, manage custom services, tune routers, and control plugins/mTLS from a single UI. It works with Pangolin or directly with Traefik as the data source and generates Traefik dynamic config (e.g., `resource-overrides.yml`) automatically.

<Callout type="info" title="Who this is for">
- Operators deploying with Pangolin or standalone Traefik
- Platform/SRE teams managing routers, services, plugins, and mTLS
- Contributors extending the Go API or React/Vite UI
</Callout>

## What you can do

- Discover resources from Pangolin or Traefik and override routers/services safely
- Create and assign Traefik middlewares with priorities and templates
- Define custom services (load balancer, weighted, mirroring, failover)
- Install/manage plugins (writes to Traefik static config) and restart Traefik as needed
- Enable mTLS via the `mtlswhitelist` plugin with per-resource rules
- Inspect Traefik routers/services/middlewares via the built-in explorer
